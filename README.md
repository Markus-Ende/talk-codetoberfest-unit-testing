# Unit Test Examples

These are the unit testing examples for my talk "Here's to Unit Tests!" at the FrankenJS Codetoberfest meetup from 2018/09/20. The beer fest example was highly inspired by [Jay Fields' "Working Effectively With Unit Tests"](http://blog.jayfields.com/2014/05/working-effectively-with-unit-tests.html).

Examples are in TypeScript, but I did not use any sophisticated language features, so it should be possible to understand them, without deep knowledge of the language.
